## Hi! I'm Jon

I'm a software developer and full-time single dad, and I've created and currently maintain more than 1,000 open source projects.

## Please sponsor me

Open source software takes a lot of time to create and maintain. Please consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/jonschlinkert) me to help me create better developer experiences, or simply say thank you for existing projects.

## Open source

I maintain more than 1,000 open source projects on GitHub, which are cumulatively downloaded over [8.5 billion times every month](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?author=jonschlinkert), which represents about 7% of the total downloads in Node.js. You or your organization are most likely using at least one of my libraries somewhere in your open source supply chain.

The following chart only shows my "personal" stats, but I'm a maintainer and contributors to hundreds of other projects on dozens of organizations.
