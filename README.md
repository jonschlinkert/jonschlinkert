I'm a software developer and full-time single dad, and I've created and currently maintain more than 1,000 open source projects. Open source software takes a lot of time to create and maintain. Please [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/jonschlinkert) me to help me create better developer experiences, or simply say thank you for existing projects.
